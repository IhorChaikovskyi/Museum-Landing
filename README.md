# Features Overview

On this site, as well as on the previous one (Bike landing page), an adaptive and responsive layout is implemented, but taking into account a more complex grid. A small slider is written using JavaScript and DOM elements, and several scripts for working with the menu window.

As in the previous work, I use the SCSS technology, where I also worked with mixins, variables and cycles. The work was carried out according to the BEM methodology, where the birth block was implemented in a separate SCSS file. The work of the SCSS cycle was performed in a more complex confluence of grids with a container, thanks to which it is enough implement regular classes in the HTML block. Each interactive element is animated for better interaction with the user. Smooth animation of the transition of the menu to different sections is also implemented.
